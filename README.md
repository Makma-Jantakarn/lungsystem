# lungsystem
A project developed for the exam of Pervasive Systems. It takes trace of the quality of the air you breathe. Data are collected into the cloud through the use of sensors attached to a STM32 Nucleo board. Access to the data is provided by a visualisation system and a chat bot assistant.
